# Task 1: Student Performance Analysis

## Objective:
The goal of this task is to analyze student exam scores and find insights using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Files:
- **Task1_Student_Performance.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of student performance, answering key questions, and visualizing data.

## Steps Taken:
1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
3. **Analysis**: Answered key questions such as:
   - Average final grade (G3).
   - Number of students scoring above 15 in G3.
   - Correlation between study time and G3.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to support findings (histograms, scatter plots, etc.).

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
